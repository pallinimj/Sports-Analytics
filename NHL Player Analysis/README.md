This project performs a clustering analysis on the different player positions in the NHL.  The clustering separates forwards, defensemen, and goalies into specific groupings based on a set of traditional and advanced stats for each position.  All player stats come from hockey-reference.com.  Player salaries for the 2019-2020 are pulled from Sporttrac (sporttrac.com/nhl).  Each team's position groupings are then compared to the rest of the league based on the player clusters and the salaries within that cluster.
