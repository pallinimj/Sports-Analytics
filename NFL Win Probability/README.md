NFL IN GAME WIN PROBABILITY

This model produces an in game win probability model based on all NFL regular season games from the 2015-2019 seasons.  The probability model incorporates play situations (down, distance, field position) and game situations (score, home/away, time remaining) to determine a team's win probability before each play in a game.
